# Data-Driven-Fitness-My-Tableau-Dashboard-Journey

Excited to share my latest project: a personalized fitness tracker dashboard built in Tableau. This interactive tool provides a comprehensive view of my health data, from daily steps and heart rate to sleep patterns and calorie intake.

By visualizing this information, I've gained valuable insights into my fitness habits and identified areas for improvement. It's been a rewarding experience to leverage data analytics to support my wellness goals.
